# 🎓 University FAQ Assistant

An AI-powered University FAQ Assistant built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.  
The system enables students to ask natural language questions and receive accurate, document-grounded answers from official university documents.

## 🚀 Features
- Natural language question answering
- Document-based retrieval using vector search (FAISS)
- Source citation for transparency
- Scalable document ingestion pipeline
- Clean web-based chat interface

## 🧠 Architecture
The project follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow:

1. University documents (PDFs) are ingested and processed.
2. Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings.
3. FAISS is used for efficient similarity search.
4. Relevant document chunks are retrieved for a user query.
5. A response is generated based on retrieved context.
